name: "Video Content Summarization and Documentation System"
description: |

## Purpose
This PRP outlines a placeholder framework for an intelligent video content summarization system that extracts key concepts, themes, and knowledge from processed videos to build comprehensive documentation. This system will analyze video transcripts and metadata to create structured, searchable knowledge artifacts that capture the essential information and insights from video content.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global rules**: Be sure to follow all rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal
To develop an intelligent content analysis system that transforms raw video transcripts into structured, comprehensive documentation. The system should extract key concepts, identify learning objectives, create topic hierarchies, and generate various documentation formats (summaries, guides, reference materials) that capture the essential knowledge from video content.

## Why
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Convert video content into structured, searchable knowledge that's easier to reference and study
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically create learning materials, study guides, and reference documentation from video content
- **Concept Mapping**: Identify relationships between topics and concepts across multiple videos
- **Content Organization**: Structure video knowledge into hierarchical documentation that supports different learning styles
- **Accessibility**: Make video knowledge accessible in text form for different consumption preferences
- **Knowledge Retention**: Create persistent documentation that outlasts individual video sessions

## What
The video content summarization system will:
- Analyze video transcripts and extracted keywords to identify key concepts and themes
- Extract learning objectives, main points, and supporting details from video content
- Create hierarchical topic structures that organize concepts from basic to advanced
- Generate multiple documentation formats: executive summaries, detailed guides, quick references, and study materials
- Identify cross-video concept relationships and build knowledge graphs
- Create structured documentation with proper headings, bullet points, and logical flow
- Support different summarization levels: brief overviews, moderate summaries, and comprehensive guides
- Extract actionable insights, recommendations, and key takeaways from instructional content
- Generate searchable documentation that integrates with the catalog database
- Create documentation templates that can be customized for different content types

### Success Criteria
- [ ] System can process video transcripts and identify key concepts automatically
- [ ] Multiple documentation formats are generated (summaries, guides, references)
- [ ] Generated documentation is well-structured with clear hierarchies and flow
- [ ] Cross-video concept relationships are identified and documented
- [ ] Documentation quality is sufficient for learning and reference purposes
- [ ] System supports different summarization depths and formats
- [ ] Generated content integrates seamlessly with the catalog database

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks
```yaml
# PLACEHOLDER GOTCHAS - To be refined based on implementation approach

# CRITICAL: AI model API rate limits and costs - summarization can be expensive for long content
# CRITICAL: Context window limitations - long transcripts may need chunking strategies
# CRITICAL: Content quality varies - some videos may not have sufficient structure for good summaries
# CRITICAL: Concept extraction accuracy depends on domain-specific terminology and context
# CRITICAL: Cross-video concept linking requires sophisticated NLP and may have false positives
# CRITICAL: Documentation quality assessment is subjective and hard to automate
# CRITICAL: Template system needs to be flexible enough for various content types and formats
```

## Future Exploration Areas

This PRP serves as a placeholder for deeper exploration of:

1. **AI Model Selection**: Evaluate different AI models for summarization quality, cost, and performance
2. **Content Analysis Techniques**: Research advanced NLP techniques for concept extraction and theme identification
3. **Documentation Formats**: Explore various documentation formats and user interface options
4. **Quality Assessment**: Develop methods to assess and improve documentation quality
5. **Personalization**: Consider user preferences and customization options for documentation style
6. **Integration Patterns**: Define how summarization integrates with search, recommendations, and user workflows

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Preliminary)
- ❌ Don't implement complex AI workflows without understanding cost and performance implications
- ❌ Don't create rigid documentation templates that don't adapt to content variety
- ❌ Don't ignore context window limitations when processing long transcripts
- ❌ Don't generate summaries without quality assessment and validation mechanisms
- ❌ Don't build cross-video analysis without considering accuracy and false positive rates
- ❌ Don't create documentation that duplicates existing transcript content without adding value
