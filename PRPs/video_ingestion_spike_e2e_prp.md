name: "Video Ingestion Spike: End-to-End Validation"description: |

## Purpose
This PRP outlines a focused spike to perform an end-to-end validation of the core technologies required for video ingestion: `ffmpeg` for audio extraction, the Video-Llama model for actual transcription, and NLP techniques for topic extraction. The output will be a markdown file containing the transcript and identified topics with timestamps. This spike aims to confirm the full pipeline's functionality and identify any practical limitations or setup challenges.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global rules**: Be sure to follow all rules in GEMINI.md

---

## Goal
To successfully extract audio from an MP4 video file, transcribe it using a *real* Video-Llama model (not simulated), extract topics from the transcription, and output the full transcript along with a list of topics and their corresponding timestamps to a markdown file. This will validate the entire core ingestion pipeline and confirm the user's system is capable of running these processes.

## Why
- To confirm that `ffmpeg` is correctly installed and efficiently extracts audio.
- To verify that the Video-Llama model can be successfully loaded, configured, and used for actual transcription on the user's system, assessing its performance and resource consumption.
- To validate the basic functionality of topic extraction from a real transcript.
- To ensure the user has all necessary software and configurations in place for full feature development.
- To understand the quality and format of the transcription and topic extraction output from Video-Llama.

## What
This spike will implement a functional subset of the video ingestion pipeline:
- Accepting a local file path to an MP4 video as input.
- Extracting the audio track from the video using `ffmpeg`.
- Loading and using the Video-Llama model to transcribe the extracted audio.
- Processing the transcription to identify key topics and their timestamps.
- Generating a markdown file containing the full transcript and a structured list of identified topics with their start and end timestamps.
- Providing clear feedback on the success or failure of each step, especially regarding external tool/model setup and execution.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] User can run a CLI command to initiate the spike.
- [ ] `ffmpeg` successfully extracts audio from a provided MP4 video.
- [ ] The Video-Llama model is successfully loaded and performs actual transcription.
- [ ] Topics and their timestamps are successfully extracted from the transcription.
- [ ] A markdown file is generated with the video's transcript and a structured list of topics/timestamps.
- [ ] Clear error messages are provided if `ffmpeg` or Video-Llama operations fail.
- [ ] The generated markdown file is readable and contains the expected information.

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks
```python
# CRITICAL: ffmpeg MUST be installed and accessible in the system's PATH. This is the primary point of failure for audio extraction.
# CRITICAL: Video-Llama models are typically very large and require significant computational resources (e.g., GPU, large RAM). Users MUST ensure they have the necessary hardware and have downloaded the model weights.
# CRITICAL: The exact method for loading and using Video-Llama will depend on the specific version and its Python API. The user will need to follow the Video-Llama GitHub instructions carefully.
# CRITICAL: Model setup (downloading weights, configuring paths) can be time-consuming and complex. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions in the README.
# CRITICAL: Handling various video codecs and formats can be complex; ensure robust error handling for unsupported formats.
# CRITICAL: Large video files will result in long transcription times and high resource usage.
# CRITICAL: Topic extraction from raw transcripts can be noisy. The quality of extracted topics will depend on the NLP techniques used.
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data models and structure

# Manual test:
# 1. Ensure you have a small MP4 video file (e.g., 10-30 seconds) for testing.
# 2. IMPORTANT: Follow the Video-Llama installation instructions from its GitHub repository (linked in Documentation & References). This includes installing dependencies and downloading model weights.
# 3. Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and in your system's PATH.
# 4. Ensure spaCy model 'en_core_web_sm' is downloaded: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
# 5. Run the spike command:
#    uv run python src/main.py spike-ingest --video-path /path/to/your/test_video.mp4

# Expected Output:
# - Console messages indicating audio extraction progress.
# - Console messages indicating Video-Llama model loading and transcription progress.
# - A new markdown file (e.g., `spike_output_xxxx.md`) will be created in your current working directory.

# Expected Content of Markdown File:
# - A clear title with the video filename.
# - The full transcript generated by Video-Llama.
# - A structured list of identified topics, each with estimated start and end timestamps, and the corresponding text segment.

# Expected Failures (and their messages):
# - If ffmpeg is not installed: "Spike failed: ffmpeg not found. Please install ffmpeg and ensure it's in your system's PATH."
# - If video path is invalid: "Error: Video file not found at /path/to/your/test_video.mp4"
# - If Video-Llama model loading fails (e.g., missing weights, incorrect path, insufficient GPU): "Spike failed: Failed to load Video-Llama model. Ensure it's installed and configured correctly: ..."
# - If Video-Llama transcription fails: "Spike failed: Video-Llama transcription failed: ..."
```

## Final validation Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass: `uv run pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] No linting errors: `uv run ruff check src/`
- [ ] No type errors: `uv run mypy src/`
- [ ] Manual test successful: `uv run python src/main.py spike-ingest --video-path /path/to/your/test_video.mp4`
- [ ] Error cases (ffmpeg not found, invalid video path, Video-Llama issues) are handled gracefully and provide clear messages.
- [ ] Logs are informative but not verbose.
- [ ] `ffmpeg` is confirmed to be installed and working.
- [ ] Video-Llama model is confirmed to be loadable and performs actual transcription.
- [ ] The generated markdown file contains the full transcript and correctly formatted topics with timestamps.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't skip `ffmpeg` or Video-Llama installation; this spike *requires* them to be functional.
- ❌ Don't hardcode paths; use `os.path.join` and temporary directories for intermediate files.
- ❌ Don't ignore Video-Llama model resource requirements (e.g., GPU, memory); clearly communicate these to the user.
- ❌ Don't expect perfect topic extraction or timestamping in this spike; the goal is basic functionality validation.
